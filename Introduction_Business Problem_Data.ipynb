Being such a highly regarded institution, it is clear why many students in Toronto and across the world take the leap to study here and proudly wear their UofT merchandise! The University of Toronto has 3 campuses across Toronto (St.George, Scarborough, Mississauga) where the most popular campus is St.George, located in the heart of Downtown Toronto. \n\nDuring my studies at the St.George campus, I found myself often asking what I want to have for lunch and what to do after I complete my exams. Even as a Toronto native myself, I found myself being confused with the sheer number of restaurants and venues located so close by! I find myself asking this question, as well as many of my peers when I ask what they want to eat for lunch. It is nice to have variety and have a nice pace of change every so often, but many people like to stick to their one favourite spot because of the fear of spending money on bad food (the worst feeling!). How can students reliably choose restaurants worthwhile while studying in Downtown Toronto? For those studying abroad and new to the area, what are some highly recommended places for them to eat from? \n\n[1] https://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-ranked-first-canada-among-world-s-top-20-universities-times-higher-education \nhttps://www.utoronto.ca/about-u-of-t/quick-facts (Will add to references section later) \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Business Problem"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "For this project, I would like to create a guide that can help freshmans make healthy and delicious changes to their diets while studying in Downtown Toronto. After all, a statistic of 8480 undergraduates have joined the University of Toronto St.George campus during the Fall 2019-20 semester alone. Accounting with the fact that over 23000 international students [2], it can be very hard for freshman and international students to navigate through Downtown Toronto and happily experiment with new foods. The goal of the guide is to be able to tell students at the University of Toronto (St.George campus) which restaurants are best to eat at in the Downtown area, categorized by their food type. \n\n[2] https://www.utoronto.ca/about-u-of-t/quick-facts (Will add to references section later) "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "To perform the analysis to make the recommendation for students, I will need the following information: \n1.
